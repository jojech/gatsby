I'm a software developer who's collected a few hats over the years working for different startups. 

Some of my recent projects include 
- creating a streamlined reporting interface and REST API allowing clients to parse millions of rows into useful data, 
- building a custom integration with Zapier allowing clients to automate their workflows with over 5,000 other apps, 
- and redesigning the infrastructure for the top advocacy platform in the market to scale with its rapid growth in the tens of millions of users.

But I'm also known for being the board game guy!
