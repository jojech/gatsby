I'm a software developer who's collected a few hats over the years working for different startups. 

Some of my recent projects include 
- creating a streamlined reporting interface allowing clients to parse millions of rows into useful data, 
- building an API integration with Zapier allowing clients to automate their workflows with over 5k other apps, 
- and adding serverless architecture to the top advocacy software in the market. 

But I'm also known for being the board game guy!
